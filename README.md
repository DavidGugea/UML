## 1. Einf체hrung / Starting out 

The are 6 phases of Software Development are:

- I   Feasibility Study & Requirements Analysis ( Analysis - Phsae )
- II  Design
- III Development & Documentation
- IV  Testing
- V   Deployment / Implementation
- VI  Maintenace & Support

**I Analysis - Phase**

In this phase, detailed analysis is performed to make sure that the software will meet the requirements of the client. This phase is necessarey to make adjustments and to ensure that software functions property at the end. The project team will answer some key questions at this point:

- Can this project actually be completed:
    - On time ?
    - Within budget ? 
    - Within existing staff ?
- Buy vs Build may also be performed at this point. In some cases outsourcing the project might be a more efficient idea 

After the feasibility study we get into the requirements analysis sub-phase where business analysts build a requirements specification that must include : 
- Business Rules
- Security requirements ( roles )
- Use cases
- Sample screen designs & sample reports

These requirements are approved by the customer prior to design work. In this phase, the software architect discusses with all the people involved in the interview with the client about what the requested software can accomplish and with what other system it has to interact with

**II Design** 

Once the first phase is complete, the step of designing takes over, which is basically building the architecture of the project. This step helps remove possible flaws by setting a standard and attempting to stick to it. These are some questions that must be answered in this phase:

* What software architecture is needed ? Is for example a database needed ? 
* How will the UI be designed ? 
* What programming languages and developmental environments are needed ? What do the developers have to know in order to contribute to the project ? When are the workeres available ? 
* What quality assurance measures need to be taken for the project ? 

The models build in this phase serve as a coummunication-foundation etween hte software architects and the programmers

**III Development & Documentation**
This is the coding phase where programmers can use the models from the first 2 phases to build the desired software

**IV Testing**
Before the project can be deployed, a critical phase of testing must start first, where the desired software is examined in order to ensure the system works properly.

**V Deployment / Implementation**
After a successful testing phase, the software gets deployed to the customer

**VI Maintenance & Support**
Once the software passes through all the stages without any issues, a maintenace process is followed wherein it will be maintained and upgraded from time to time to adapt to changes.

* Help desk is usuall formed to suport users problems and questions
* Software fixes are developed at this point
* Patching and maintenance operations begin
